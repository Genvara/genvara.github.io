Im now going to start mentioning people as in communities, because writing names would be a pain, don't be sad because
i didn't put your name up there, it's just too much, i will update the Wall O' Names™ as time goes on.
Thanks to:
The Golden Organization: Met some people who are in the ROBLOX anime fighting community, they play a bunch of jojo fan
games, soulshatter is a cool fighting game too, the people are very nice :))
The .IO Community: Yes, every single clan that still exists/or existed before, thank you, without you i wouldn't able to
have a lot of friends and meet bunch of cool people, especially in the year 2016-2018, or even now, love you guys <3.
BORED and SBK (sinbad knights for short): While SBK being a .IO clan, there were a lot of talented people of there, from
artists/designers, programmers, and others... some of them are very known today :)
Nightosphere: Possibly the best community in the middle east and north africa, great youtube content that is not like the
usual arabian content that you see nowadays, with amazing artists posting their work in the discord server.
Dogu's Funhouse: While being based on ROBLOX, there's a ton of great people on there, also like your work dogu <3.
The Discord Mod Volunteers: Shoutouts to them for moderating HUGE discord servers, we are talking about servers that reach
100k members, and moderating official discord servers.
That's it for Wall O' Communities i guess.

Again, i will update this at any time, i hope github doesn't shut down and all of this will be gone to waste, Love all of you.
